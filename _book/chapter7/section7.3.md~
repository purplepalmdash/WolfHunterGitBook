## Python Web Framework
Being a tool, its `ease of use` is very important for its spread. So in this section we will introduce a simple yet powerful web-framework for making the web interface for integration of Cobbler and Ansible.   

### Prepare

```
# yum install -y gcc python-pip python-devel
# pip install bottle ansible 
```

### Bottle
Bottle is a fast, simple and lightweight WSGI micro web-framework for Python, its website is:   
[http://www.bottlepy.org](http://www.bottlepy.org)    

You could follow the tutorial here for setting up a simple webserver:   
[http://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/index.html](http://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/index.html)   

### Using Bottle For Integration
We implemented following web routers in our python script:    

listsystem: list all of the installed node information in Cobbler.     
newsystem:  Add a new node into Cobbler.      
Node/nodename: Page for serving a single node during its deployment.     
Deploy/nodename: Page for serving the deploying node.    

These pages could be beautified using different js or css framework. Currently they didn't been prettified too much.   

### Deployment Thread
A Thread has been imported for serving the deployment precedure.    
In this thread we could directly call one play-book, and let it run the deployment for us.   

### End Of The Section
We use Bottle for combine the Cobbler/Ansible and provide the end-user a simple WEB UI. This provides a start-point for invoving more functionality.
