## Node Static IP
Use Static IP could easily remember the deployment parameter, so before we really deploy the nodes, we setup the static IP in Inner Network.     

### Change Cobbler's DHCP Setting
Cobbler managed the inner network's DHCP, now we played some tricks for letting the IP address pool releases more Static IP adresses for configuration.    

In Cobbler Server:   

```
# vim /etc/cobbler/dhcp.template
     range dynamic-bootp        10.15.33.100 10.15.33.254;
# cobbler sync
```
Check the dhcpd's configuration file:  

```
# cat /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf
....
     range dynamic-bootp        10.15.33.100 10.15.33.254;
```
So now the 10.15.33.3~ 10.15.33.99 is for static IP Address ranges.   

### Change CS Management 's IP 

```
# vim /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0
DEVICE="eth0"
- BOOTPROTO="dhcp"
+ BOOTPROTO="static"
+ IPADDR="10.15.33.5"
```

### Change CS Agent 's IP 

```
# vim /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth1 
- BOOTPROTO=dhcp
+ BOOTPROTO=static
+ IPADDR=10.15.33.6
```

### End Of This Section
By assigning the static IP Address, we could more precisely control the deployment.
